## Docker Deployment

After setting up the environment variables and ensuring Docker and Docker Compose are installed, the script will:

1. Stop any running r136 Docker containers
2. Pull the latest Docker images (if auto-update is enabled)
3. Start the r136 services using Docker Compose

## Troubleshooting

- If the script fails to run on Linux, run it with `sudo`.
- If you encounter any issues with Docker installation:
  - On Linux, ensure you have sudo privileges and that your system is up to date.
  - On macOS and Windows, follow the instructions to install Docker Desktop manually if the script cannot install it automatically.
- Check the Docker logs for any error messages if the containers fail to start.
- Verify that all required ports are available and not in use by other services.
- If the `python` command is not recognized, try using `python3` instead.

## Security Considerations

- The `r136_API_KEY` is automatically generated if not provided. Ensure to keep this key secure and do not share it publicly.
- When using authentication providers (GitHub, Google, Microsoft), ensure that the client IDs and secrets are kept confidential.
- Be cautious when enabling file uploads and voice input, as these features may introduce potential security risks if not properly managed.

## Configuration

Each r136 Agent has its own settings for interfacing with AI providers, and other configuration options. These settings can be set and modified through the web interface.
